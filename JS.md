# JS

ariables as elements used to describe a logic process. Allows you to plan or describe a logic without having the values themselves. 

Instead of using the class to select elements from the DOM, a better practice is to use the attribute data-js.

`const mainElement = document.queryselector('[data-js="main"]')`
